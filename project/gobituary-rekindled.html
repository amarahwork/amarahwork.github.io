                        <h3>Challenge</h3>
                        <p>This project sought to spark personal reflection and a deeper sense of civic connectedness by presenting history not as a fixed record but as a participatory and evolving dialogue.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>Gobituary Rekindled is a hybrid digital-physical history project that invites university community members to engage with the legacy of individuals who shaped the early development of UC Berkeley. By learning about the lives of those who made a mark on their communities (for better or for worse), users are encouraged to consider their own stories and how they, too, might shape the future of their institutions and neighborhoods.</p>

                <h2>How it Works</h2>
                    <div class="flex">
                    <div class="description">
                        <p>The monument is portable. It can be set somewhere with heavy foot traffic, or tucked away in the corner for the opportunity for quiet reflection. Its shape and dimensions were designed such that it can attract attention without interupting the environment that it's set in.</p>
                        <p>A user can approach the monument, and read the names on the panel. The controller invites interaction, and moving it from one name to another will trigger the monitor set inside of the monument to change to a cooresponding collage.</p>
                        <p>Because the monitor is set low in the monument, the user has to make an effort to peer inside. The collages are enhanced by the surrounding mirrors, which creates a greater sense of depth. It's also a literal representation of one of the project's core themes of reflection.</p>
                        <p>After looking through each collage, the user might notice each has a corresponding QR code. They can scan it to be directed to the website, which features curated and points of interest. These aren't full biographies, of course. The selections are inspired by the experience of cemetery tours and are meant to highlight specific points of relation, either personal or in the greater impact the historical figure had on their community.</p>
                        <p>The interaction loop inspires exploration, however the depth of information increases linearly. This prevents a user from being overwhemled or lost. Our goal was for a user to walk away with the sense that, even seemingly small contributions to a community, might positively or negatively have its effects felt decades or centuries later. Some fun facts might be good to bring out at parties, too.</p>

                    <p>This project is an extention of the <a href="https://www.gobituary.app/">Gobituary website</a> (created by Anna Lanzino), and similarly seeks to enhance understanding of local history. As a group, we all found a strong interest in cemeteries and how they can operate as museums. In fact, many historic cemeteries offer tours that are very informative and worthwhile! We saw this as an opportunity for exploration.</p>
                    <p>Since convincing people that cemeteries are actually super cool is a tall task (and I doubt my attempt two sentences ago convinced you),  we chose to bring the cemetery to campus instead. However, rather than the broader surrounding community as a whole, Gobituary Rekindled's <strong>target audience</strong> is <strong>university students</strong> who routinely have weaker ties to their community due to the transient nature of their residency in college towns.</p>

They also include various images that hint or give context to their contributions to the community. In cemetery tours, docents will typically share short stories about the deceased rather than provide a full biography. Similarly, we wanted to differentiate the presentation of accomplishments from what would be standard in a history book and <strong>highlight</strong> the still-felt residual effects of their <strong>involvement or contributions</strong> to the UC Berkeley campus.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, to highlight their affiliations to the university, the palette was constrained to <strong>blue and yellow</strong>, a nod to the university's colors. The design heavily incorporates light motifs in reference to the university's slogan <strong>&ldquo;fiat lux&rdquo;</strong> (&ldquo;let there be light&rdquo;), and the quilt motif was inspired by the AIDS Memorial Quilt which also sought to humanize community members by using small snapshots of life to assemble an entire tapestry of human connection. The quilt pattern in particular is commonly known as <em>bear tracks</em>, which, of course, reference's the university's mascot.</p>
