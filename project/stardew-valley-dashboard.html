                        <h3>Challenge</h3>
                        <p>Between me and two of my friends, it was decided that existing tools to aid players in optimizing gameplay for the award-winning farming simulator game, Stardew Valley, were insufficient.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>We created three dashboards using Observable Plot to act as at-a-glance guides for the various qualities of in-game items. Item lookup is now much more efficient than navigating the widly-used <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Stardew Valley Wiki.</a></p>

                        <p>Research, development, and design decisions were also contributed by Rachel Fung and Anita Guo.</p>
                        <p>Game-related imagery (buttons, item sprites, map, etc.) were borrowed directly from Stardew Valley, made by ConcernedApe.</p>

            <h2>Data Organization</h2>   
            <section>
                <p>For this project, we created tidy datasets for each item type (crops, fish, animal products) by referencing <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Stardew Valley Wiki</a> for relevant metadata about each item. For example, for crops, we collected the following information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crop name</li>
                    <li>Crop type ( fruit, tree, vegetable, forageable, flower, other)</li>
                    <li>Season availability (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)</li>
                    <li>Seed price</li>
                    <li>Days to initial harvest</li>
                    <li>Days to regrow (for multi-yield crops)</li>
                    <li>Yield per harvest</li>
                    <li>Maximum number of harvests per season</li>
                    <li>Harvest frequency under different fertilizers: Speed-Gro, Deluxe Speed-Gro, Hyper Speed-Gro</li>
                    <li>Impact of the Agriculturist profession on fertilizer-enhanced growth rates</li>
                    <li>Base sell price by quality: Normal, Silver, Gold, Iridium</li>
                    <li>Tiller profession price multipliers by quality</li>
                    <li>Keg product output (Juice, Wine) and:</li>
                    <li>Base and Artisan profession prices by quality</li>
                    <li>Preserves Jar output (Pickle, Jelly) and:</li>
                    <li>Base and Artisan profession prices by quality</li>
                    <li>Dehydrator product (Dried Fruit, Dried Mushroom) and:</li>
                    <li>Base and Artisan profession prices by quality</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>We made deliberate decisions about which data to include and exclude. While our datasets are rich in numerical detail, we chose to omit broader global multipliers, like general profession-based price boosts, from most visualizations to avoid distorting trends across categories.</p>
                <p>For use in the dashboard, the data is fed in by parsing the JSON in which it is stored and accessed further through key-value pairs. The charts and graphs of the dashboard change in accordance to the selected item.</p>
